To cultivate a quiet and focused learning environment, the instructor can employ a multifaceted approach. 
Establishing clear expectations at the beginning of the semester and utilizing non-verbal cues, such as eye contact and strategic pauses, can effectively communicate the importance of maintaining a respectful atmosphere. Implementing a well-defined attendance policy that deducts points for disruptive behavior serves as a deterrent, encouraging students to remain attentive. Additionally, 
seat arrangements can be adjusted to minimize side conversations, and engaging teaching methods can capture students' interest.
